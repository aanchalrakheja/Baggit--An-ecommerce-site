                <p>When you shop at a thrift store, it’s exciting to think about what you might find. The thrill of the hunt is what compels most people to shop at a thrift store. Most thrift store shoppers are also creative people. They’re able to think outside the box to envision new life for a gently used item. For example, clothing at a thrift store isn’t necessarily in-season, but those who buy clothes at a thrift store are able to get creative to express their own personal style in a way that is relevant to what’s in-season.</p>
